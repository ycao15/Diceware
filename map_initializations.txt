The first few entries in the map/dictionary holding the words
Github cannot seem to display them all on one line and putting 
a newline after every word entry would be very messy, so this is
just a document showing how the data structures were initialized 
under the comment:
	// the massive map of diceware words (7776 total)
    // probably more efficient than parsing a file for every word

C++
map<int, string> words = {{11111,"a"}, {11112,"a&p"},{11113,"a's"}} 

Python (Dictionary)
words_dict = {11111: "a", 11112: "a&p", 11113: "a's"}
