The first few entries in the map/dictionary holding the words.

Github can't seem to display the initializationd correctly (it cuts off most of the entries).
Giving each entry its own line would be really messy and make the file really long in terms of lines.
I'm not sure what's going on here because I've seen a few files on Github with very long lines that
displayed properly. I'll have these files backed up in Google Drive as well then.

Here's how the map/dictionary was initialized under the comment:
	// the massive map of diceware words (7776 total)
    // probably more efficient than parsing a file for every word

C++ (map)
map<int, string> words = {{11111,"a"}, {11112,"a&p"},{11113,"a's"}};

Python (Dictionary)
words_dict = {11111: "a", 11112: "a&p", 11113: "a's"}
