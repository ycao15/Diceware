I implemented the Diceware password generation method in C++ and Python. 
More information about this method can be found here: http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html

Using a computer to generate random numbers for use in the Diceware method is technically not as secure
as with physical dice. However, since these programs use /dev/urandom, it is in practice random enough for most purposes.
