## Diceware
This program generates a password consisting of random words from a wordlist. 
Each word is accessed by generating a key. 

The key is normally generated by rolling dice six times and concatenating the 
digits together. In this case, it is created using a random number generator. 
To be absolutely sure that the numbers generated are random, it's safer to actually
roll the dice, but since the generator in this program uses /dev/urandom, it's fairly
secure for most purposes.

The wordlist included comes from the Electronic Frontier Founcation.
